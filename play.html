        <h5>SCENE II.--HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES.</h5>
            
        <h6>JAC.</h6><p>(_at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he
            came in_).I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his
                feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling.</p>

        <h6>HAR.</h6> <p>What! Him who has robbed me?</p>

        <h6>JAC.</h6> <p>I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
            me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.</p>

        <h6>HAR.</h6><p>This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of
            something else to this gentleman.</p> 
        <h6>OFF.</h6> <p>(_to_ JACQUES). Don't get frightened. I am not a man to cause any
            scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means.</p>

        <h6>JAC.</h6> <p>(_to_ HARPAGON). Is this gentleman coming to supper with you?</p>

        <h6>OFF.</h6> <p>You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your
            master.</p>

        <h6>JAC.</h6> <p>Indeed, Sir, I will show you all I know, and will treat you in
            the best manner I possibly can.</p>
