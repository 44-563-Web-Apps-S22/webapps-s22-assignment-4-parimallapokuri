        <h5>SCENE I.--HARPAGON, A POLICE OFFICER. </h5>
            
        JAC. (_at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he
        came in_). I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his
        feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling.

        HAR. What! Him who has robbed me?

        JAC. I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
        me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.

        HAR. This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of
        something else to this gentleman.

        OFF. (_to_ JACQUES). Don't get frightened. I am not a man to cause any
        scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means.

        JAC. (_to_ HARPAGON). Is this gentleman coming to supper with you?

        OFF. You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your
        master.

        JAC. Indeed, Sir, I will show you all I know, and will treat you in
        the best manner I possibly can.
